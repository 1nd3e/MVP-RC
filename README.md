# MVP-RC

A MVP module template with Router and Configurator for Xcode.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the MVP-RC repository.
2. Go to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates`. If you don't have the Templates folder, you must create it.
3. If the Templates folder is empty, create a `File Templates` folder and inside it another folder named `Custom`. You should get the following path: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Custom`.
4. Copy `MVP-RC Module.xctemplate` to `Custom` folder.
5. That's all, done.

## Usage

Open a project in Xcode. Choose where you want to create a MVP-RC module, press `CMD+N` or go to `File -> New -> File`. Search for the MVP-RC Module (it's at the bottom, in a section called Custom). Choose the MVP-RC Module, enter a name for your next module and create it.

## Best Practices

1. Create a separate folder for your modules (screens) in the project.
2. Separate your modules by folders: Feed, Feed Detail, etc.
3. Group your module files by a context.

Example project structure:
```
Project
--- Modules
--- --- Feed
--- --- --- Model
--- --- --- --- Feed.swift
--- --- --- View
--- --- --- --- FeedViewController.swift
--- --- --- Presenter
--- --- --- --- FeedPresenter.swift
--- --- --- Router
--- --- --- --- FeedRouter.swift
--- --- --- Configurator
--- --- --- --- FeedConfigurator.swift
--- --- Feed Detail
--- --- --- Model
--- --- --- --- FeedDetail.swift
--- --- --- View
--- --- --- --- FeedDetailViewController.swift
--- --- --- Presenter
--- --- --- --- FeedDetailPresenter.swift
--- --- --- Router
--- --- --- --- FeedDetailRouter.swift
--- --- --- Configurator
